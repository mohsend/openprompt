# Openprompt
A simple Teleprompt web app.

## How to use

Open `index.html` in your browser (locally or from a host), enter **Edit** mode, paste the text you want to prompt, click on **Done** and start using it.

  right: 0;
To save the prompt for later use, while in **Edit** mode simply save the webpage (by hitting ` ctrl + s ` on PC or ` cmd + s ` on a mac). The saved page (along with the accompanying directory) can act as a standalone prompter.

You can find [the webapp hosted here](https://mehsen.com/openprompt).
